Like if you have invested: 1 matic - watch live streams (livepeer) 10 matic - do live chat(Push chat) with the creator 100 matic - do live video calling(huddle01) There would be a nominal fees for registering yourself on the platform so that is not attacked by bots and generate revenue. Uploaded videos by creators can be watched by all registered consumers but latest notifications(Push protocol) will be sent only to the channel members. This idea struck my mind just 3 days ago(therefore not able to complete it) and have great plans on working even after the hackathon',

Moving to what would have been possible given more time, the EPNS notification would have included a direct link to the NFT on Opensea, where interested parties could buy it. In a simpler implementation the revenue would go to funding a preselected public good, in a more complex version each person who contributed could vote on which public good to fund, with the money going to what the majority chose.

Here are a few examples:, - Users with multiple ledgers can create a dependency network between the wallets to protect their own funds, - Users can set relatives as guardians to protect their estate, - Users can delegate trusted organizations as part of their set of guardians for additional security, - And of course, you can fill your guardian network with some close friends',

Visibility. For both sponsors & developers. Bidirectional Communication. Progress & funding notifications., Accountability. Clear milestones & deliverables. # **The Problem**, The current state of grant programming is manual, labor intensive & inefficient- distracting both sponsors and developers from doing what they do best, building. The state of grant funding is very web2 and it’s not a good look. For the sponsor, there is a lack of clarity and accountability about project progress and completion from the developers. This black void is especially awkward in an industry built on transparency. The pain point is further highlighted in the bear, as a lot of sponsors are now questioning the progress of projects they have invested in (and asking wen return on investments?). For the developers, finding grants is often time-consuming. We love a good notion page or twitter thread, but sifting through protocols is not an efficient use of the time when we could be spent building *cough shit-posting. Once a grant is awarded, the expected milestones, deliverables and payout processes are unclear, leaving us asking wen funding?, Speaking directly with protocols, we have received feedback that many experience these pain points. For example. Harmony protocol communicates deliverables via notion, accepts and reviews grant via a talk forum, often chases developers deliverables via telegram, and coordinate multiple core team member to sends funds. There is competition for visibility between sponsors for developers- a pain point mentioned by a Cronos team member. There is also a lack of accountability & follow-through from developers. Likewise, hearing developer feedback from Gitcoin grants, there is a lack of clarity from protocols about necessary milestones & timelines- developers are left questioning wen/how funding?, **For both parties time is spent on the unnecessary instead of the innovative.**, # **The Solution**, Granted is a milestone-based granting platform for sponsors and developers to issue and apply for grants. Streamlining the grant process by notifying and tracking all the progress on projects being built so that both the developer and sponsor have open, bidirectional communication. It’s something we like to call transparency. # **The Experience**, As a sponsor:, 1) I access my token-gated portal via **Unlock Protocol** and indicate the number of grants I am funding, and outline the expected deliverables, timelines & payout for each funding tranche. 2) Once a developer is approved, they are notified via **EPNS** and streamlined through the first milestone. 3) I, the sponsor, am notified whenever they have completed a milestone. 4) I review their milestone to ensure deliverables are met. Once you click approved, funding is sent via **Polygon, Optimism or Harmony** 5) The next deliverables for the developers are automatically provided, repeating the process until the project is completed. Freeing up time for important things like touching some grass or whatever else protocols get up to. The platform provides a birds eye view of all granted projects- categorizing them by the milestones completed, making it easy to keep track of the progress of our granting program. This allows us to see who is getting shit done, and who may have gone to one too many NYC NFT parties. As a developer:, 1) I search through the granting index and apply for relevant projects each on different protocols. I access my portal via **wallet connect** can apply, see all past applications, and milestone progress. 2) My application is stored via **IPFS,** and I am notified once my application is accepted via **EPNS.** I am presented with a roadmap of all expected deliverables and payouts, along with the first milestone, expected timeline and amount I will be paid once the first tranche is appropriately completed. 3) Once I submit a milestone, the sponsor is notified., 4) Once reviewed, I am notified, funded via **Polygon, Optimism** or **Harmony** and the next expected milestone is released., 5) Process is repeated until project is completed., If, like most of us, I am working on multiple projects at once, I have an overview of all my projects and progress.

This is where Splytto comes in, through the application , the team can receive their winning amount in one wallet which is connected to Splytto and the team members can be added to the group through their ENS addresses and the money can be split and their share can be sent to their wallets through the application. Scenario 2, Another use case would be a group member paying for the entire team for dinner and is expecting their share to be paid to them, Splytto can be used to create the expense for the group which will notify the group to pay their share to the owner. This also helps in keeping a tab of your expenses with a group and is a splitting and payment solution for crypto in one!',

    info: 'Fusion Credit creates a credit score called the “FusionScore” based on multiple addresses and chains while keeping the account information private. Digital signatures are used to ensure account ownership, and zero knowledge proofs are used to hide the account information and ensure the credit score calculation is done correctly. , , Like real world credit scores (FICO score), the FusionScore enables financial products to model risk based on an individual user’s risk profile, and it is a basic building block of any financial system. Financial products, such as loans, insurance, leveraged investment accounts, etc., can offer personalized rates and services based on the credit score, making them competitive to other products, and more compelling and capital-efficient for the end user. For the credit score to be accurate and trustworthy, it needs to encompass all user activities, hence using multiple addresses on multiple chains. However, in the blockchain space, it is common to use multiple accounts for different purposes or activities, and the user may not want to make the link between all these accounts public. Fusion Credit leverages zero knowledge proofs to hide all the account information while ensuring the ownership of these accounts, as well as that the correct calculation process, is followed to generate FusionScore off chain. Not exposing the underlying account information is the main differentiator compared to other similar products in the space. , , Another unique feature of FusionScore is that the exact process to create the score is made public (built into the zero knowledge circuit). This allows the community to contribute and come up with a better methodology for a more effective score. As more DeFi products come to market, and analytics abilities improve, a new FusionScore version can be created to keep up with the latest trend. Being able to upgrade the zero knowledge proof circuit is a feature built into the Fusion Credit system. The transparency will also encourage more products to use FusionScore, integrate with Fusion Credit System, and eventually create a healthy ecosystem. Any curious individuals or organization can also verify the score. In the future, a DAO can be created to govern this process of updating the methodology of the score.',

    name: 'PayPay',
    info: 'PayPay is designed to enable various NFT lending mechanisms such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), real estate mortgages, or NFT subscriptions. A digital or real-world asset, represented as an ERC721 NFT is locked in vault managed by 2 counterparties, a lender and a borrower, for a certain amount of time., , The PayPay vault contract has various use cases. The closest analogy is that of a real estate mortgage. A bank lends a borrower funds to purchase a house. While the title of the house is transferred to the borrower, a lien is placed on the house that gives the right to the borrower to repossess it if the borrower defaults on the mortgage. PayPay vault has other use cases however, enabling Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) mechanics for users wishing to split their NFT purchase costs over time. Similarly, PayPay vault can be used for subscriptions, such as NFT DAO memberships, enabling a much more stable recurring funding system as opposed to one-time lump sum fundraising., , The lender, which is usually the original owner of the asset, earns cashflows paid by the borrower to acquire the asset before the vault expires. The borrower is looking to access the benefits of the NFT (real estate title, DAO membership) today without having to fully purchase the NFT on day 1. This is **not** a temporary rental however, as if the borrower pays both the interest and principal on the vault, the asset NFT will be unlocked and transferred to the borrower., , The borrower pays the lender 2 cashflows, principal which increments the borrower’s equity ownership, and interest, in the form of fixed coupon payments. The cashflows of the vault resemble that of a callable bond as the borrower has the option but not the obligation to fully pay the principal at any time to avoid paying future interest. Unlike a traditional bond however, all payments are continuous and streamed per second., , The vault’s risk profile is similar to that of a mortgage: if a user defaults on the payments at any time, the lender may claim the locked asset. In some circumstances, the vault may be underwater if the value of the locked NFT asset declines below the balance of the vault (remaining principal + interest), providing no incentive for the borrower to continue payments. This is by design, and lenders should look to use relatively stable assets and implicitly require a security deposit by overvaluing the required principal payment (eg. 20% premium)., , PayPay is not just an NFT lending platform but a **tradeable** lending platform. This is due to how both counterparties, lender and borrower, are actually represented as NFTs. Whoever owns the “borrower” NFT can continue payments in hopes of claiming the locked asset, and whoever owns the “lender” NFT can claim the cashflows streamed to the vault. Both roles and their associated cashflows are therefore tradeable., , Thanks to leveraging NFTs as proxies to the underlying counterparties, lender and borrower addresses do not have to be static and can be traded, bundled, or fractionalized with any marketplace or protocol that supports ERC721 NFTs. This enables a couple additional use cases. , , A lender wanting to claim the Net Present Value (NPV) of future cashflows can sell the lender NFT to a third-party that discounts those future cashflows less than the original lender (eg. views the mortgage as less risky). A borrower wanting to exit the vault but still claim the value of their accrued equity can sell the borrower NFT to someone that wishes to continue making payments to claim the NFT (eg. if the locked asset has increased in value or if the borrower thinks they might default).',

We are taking DeFi product discovery to a whole new level of fun for players, while creating a completely new channel of customer acquisition for DeFi product creators. , , Right now, it’s hard for new users to know what DeFi products are out there for them. It’s harder to try before they buy into a particular solution without upfront cost and complexity. It’s even harder to be rewarded easily for this exploration and testing. , , Hash Space combines HealthFi, DeFi, and GameFi. , 1. HealthFi: You explore the galaxy in your spaceship - powering it with your real steps. This promotes healthy habits. , 2. DeFi product discovery: The planets that you travel to are actually yield-generating vaults - earning from different DeFi protocols. Different types of planets represent different types of DeFi products, protocols and solutions. Players learn about the different options when they explore the planets.  , 3. GameFi: When you arrive at a planet you get the yield from that vault as your bounty! Or you might get nothing if another player has already beaten you to it.  ,  , Let’s find out “what’s out there” in the DeFi galaxy!, How it works:, 1. Players join by connecting their wallet and their smart device which can measure their footsteps, 2. Upon registration, players buy a Ship NFT from OpenSea. This money goes into the treasury. , 3. The treasury is deployed towards the featured or partner DeFi protocols. Earning yield through their product mechanism. , 4. When a player lands on a planet - they are given information to learn about the protocol on that planet. , 5. If any yield is present on that planet, then the player can take this as their bounty reward. , 6. Unless another player has already beaten them to it and taken the reward before them. , 7. New yield from the treasury’s earnings is added to the planets at regular intervals. ',
