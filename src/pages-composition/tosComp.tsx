                    The <B>PC token</B> is the native cryptographic token of the
                    Push Chain. Push Chain (like other blockchain networks)
                    requires the payment of transaction fees (“gas”) for the
                    execution of transactions or smart contracts. Gas fees are
                    typically paid in PCs by the sender or creator of a
                    transaction. PCs may also be used to pay transaction fees on
                    certain external blockchains that support Push
                    interoperability. Push Digital Assets, including PCs and any
                    other tokens, NFTs, or collectibles issued by us or our

                  </P>
                  <P margin='0px 0px 0px 20px'>
                    <B>4.1.</B> A crucial security mechanism of the Push is the
                    randomized selection of validators for transaction
                    validation or block production. This mechanism leverages
                    cryptographic randomness to ensure an unpredictable
                    selection of validators & attestors to enhance the network's
                    resilience and fairness.
                  </P>

                  <P margin='10px 0px 0px 20px'>
                    <B>4.2.</B> To send a transaction to the network, the
                    Software Development Kit (SDK)/sender must attach a randomly
                    generated token number to the transaction. To fetch this
                    token, the SDK can request the same from any validator. Once
                    received, the SDK attaches this token to the transaction and
                    sends it to the network. The network then uses this random
                    token to cryptographically decide the specific validator to
                    verify the particular transaction for further processing.
                    Additionally, the validator also randomly decides the
                    validator set responsible for attesting to the transaction.
                    Such are, generation of Random Token, SDK Requests for
                    Random Token, and Randomized Selection of Validators
                  </P>

                  <P margin='10px 0px 0px 20px'>
                    <B>4.3.</B> Another crucial security mechanism used by the
                    Push is slashing which penalizes validators or participants
                    who act maliciously or fail to fulfill their
                    responsibilities, such as validating transactions correctly.
                    When slashing occurs, a portion of the participant's staked
                    tokens is forfeited and removed as a penalty, discouraging
                    harmful behavior and ensuring the integrity of the network.
