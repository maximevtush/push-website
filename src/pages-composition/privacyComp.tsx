              <Span>
                Push Chain is a shared state blockchain for shared app
                experiences. It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow
                developers to create Universal Apps and act as a shared
                settlement layer for multiple layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3. It
                allows transactions from any chain, uses gas abstraction to
                ensure no hassle for interaction from other chains and provides
                wallet abstraction for seamless onboarding and signing for
                existing users. To summarize, it is a shared-state blockchain
                that eliminates fragmentation and makes apps universal. <br />
                Deploy once on Push. Users on any chain — EVM or non-EVM — use
                your app with their existing wallets and tokens; fees are
                handled under the hood.
