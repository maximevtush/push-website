We at EPNS are thrilled to announce that [Sandeep Nailwal](https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal), Co-Founder of Polygon will be joining EPNS as an Advisor.

Sandeep is the Co-Founder & COO of [Polygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon) (previously Matic Network), an Ethereum scaling infrastructure that is looking to make Ethereum a multi-chain system aka the Internet of Blockchains.

He is also the founder and instigator of India’s [CryptoRelief](https://twitter.com/cryptorelief_) Campaign, which has raked in more than $450 million dollars worth of donations at the time of writing.

Sandeep was one of the earliest backers of EPNS. His advice and guidance have been pivotal to EPNS’s growth and strategy. We look forward to his greater involvement with EPNS and helping us become the de-facto communication layer of Ethereum.

Sandeep has always been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of Web3 technology and making the Ethereum ecosystem much more user-friendly. As we build the next-generation of Web3.0 communication infrastructure — via a decentralized middleware blockchain agnostic notifications protocol — we look forward to gaining insight from Sandeep from his experience in building Polygon, and interacting with different dApps and protocols as he built the rich dApp ecosystem of Polygon, as it stands today.

When asked about Sandeep’s thoughts about joining EPNS as Advisor, Sandeep said,

> The lack of notifications and communication of key information to users of Web3 protocols and services has been one of the greatest user experience barriers in Web3. Even as Polygon looks to build a more robust and scalable decentralized network infrastructure, without a decentralized communication layer on top of it, users will find it hard to use Web3 tools and services in the long run. I’m glad EPNS is solving one of the major infrastructure gaps in the Web3 ecosystem. I’m excited to be a part of this journey and to see Harsh and Richa pull this amazing feat off.

We cannot wait to work with Sandeep and bring you the future of push notifications. Thank you Sandeep for joining us, and welcome to the EPNS Family.
