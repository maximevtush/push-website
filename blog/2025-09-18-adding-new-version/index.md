![Announcing Project G.U.D — Go Universal & Deploy on Push Chain, Win $5,000](./cover-image.webp)

<!--truncate-->

We’re excited to announce **Project G.U.D**, a 3-week-long **Deploython** where developers can port their EVM apps to Push Chain’s **Testnet Donut**, make them Universal, and compete for **$5,000 in prizes**!

👉 We just upgraded our developer chat - [join here](https://t.me/+HBr_tyPvACFhM2Vl) to learn more.

## 🌐 What is Push Chain?

[Push Chain](https://push.org?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=project_gud) is a **shared-state Layer 1 blockchain** built to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.

With Push, you can build **Universal Apps** that support transactions from any chain (Ethereum, Solana, EVM or non-EVM) without forcing users to juggle wallets, tokens, or gas mechanics.

In short: **Deploy once, go cross-chain & 10X your user base.**

## 💡 Why Should You Care?

Devs deserve better for their apps - **more users, more revenue, more distribution.**

Here’s why building on Push Chain gives you a real edge:

- **Expand Your User base Instantly**: Deploy once, reach users across EVM + non-EVM chains (yes, even Solana).
- **Avoid Audit Friction**: Since you do not modify your solidity code, there is no need for a full re-audit.
- **Simplified Fees**: Automatically routes gas fees under the hood. Users do not need to hold $PC tokens or switch chains to complete transactions.
- **Consistent DevEx**: One **Push SDK**, one set of JSON-RPC endpoints, and a unified API to build and deploy. Supports Viem, ethers, and our own Push Chain client.
- **Future-Proof Builds**: With chain-native interop, your builds are future-proof as additional chains support are just a package update instead of the current broken interop protocol route.

👉 *Note: Push Chain SDK is only accessible to contest participants.* [Register](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/pushchain-gud?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=project_gud) to unlock SDK + docs.
