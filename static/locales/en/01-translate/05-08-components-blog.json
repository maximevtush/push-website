It enables developers to deploy once, and instantly become available for users on any chain, whether EVM or Non-EVM (including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin among others). It is 100% EVM compatible, Proof of Stake (PoS) chain that allows users to interact with the apps deployed on Push Chain from any chain, as they natively do on their own chain.",
