Users never need to create a new wallet to access any apps.\n\n**Single transaction, no matter the chain** - users can interact with any app on Push Chain with a single transaction. No matter how they choose to interact with the app, they will only ever need to sign a single transaction.\n\n**Universal Smart Contracts** - Smart contracts are universal and will work instantly without any on-chain code changes or extra steps.\n\n**Shared State & Programmable Solvers** - Enables develepors to read and write state of other blockchains (Roadmap).\n\nThis results in **fully interoperable applications** for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of \"Uniswap on Ethereum,\" \"Uniswap on Polygon,\" or \"Uniswap on Arbitrum,\" a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap.**",

With the successful voting of the governance proposal, the Push Chain mission is now on its way toward building **any chain, any user, and any app.**\n\n:::warning ⚠️ Token not live yet\nThe Push Chain token is not live, nor is any presale live. The Push Chain token is not yet named.<p />\n\n\nDo not believe anyone offering early access to the Push Chain token. All communications regarding Push Chain will be announced simultaneously from official Push channels — [Twitter / X](https://x.com/PushChain 'X handle of Push Chain'), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pushchain 'Discord of Push Chain'), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject 'Telegram of Push Chain'), [Website](https://push.org 'Push Website').\n:::\n\n<br />",

Ethereum enabled innovations for DeFi. Solana enabled fast apps and meme culture. Several L2s and new L1s are targeting other areas of concern.\n\nHowever, a blockchain that is purpose-built to enable chain abstraction and seamless interoperability in the space is still required. This chain would enable transactions from any chain (ETH, SOL, EVM or non-EVM) to power apps that can be used by **any user —** no matter their chain or wallet. This is the chain of **Universal Apps**. This is Push Chain!",
                  "innovation": "### Built on innovation to eliminate blockchain isolation!\n\nPush Chain is revolutionary for both users and developers as it creates an environment for any developer to deploy their universal app in hours via a single universal smart contract deployment.\n\nIt also enables users to transact from the comfort, convenience, and choice of their ecosystem, no matter where the app resides.\n\nUnder the hood, this is achieved by:\n\n- Ability to do **transactions from any chain**\n- **Universal Fee & Wallet Abstraction** to enable users to use any chain, any wallet and pay in any token\n- **Universal Smart Contract** to enable devs to deploy instant interop apps in minutes\n- **Shared State** to read data from other blockchain\n- **Programmable Solver** to write data to any other chain\n\nAll of this enables a **Universal Execution Layer** to allow users of any chain to access and interact with the same app.",

                  "migration-details": "### Migration Details\n\nPush Chain is the result of years of learning from building the leading notification and communication protocol of web3, which was one of the first consumer apps for crypto.\n\nOwing to this, apart from the airdrop allocated (see details below) to Push Chain users, creators, developers and ecosystem partners, **there is also a migration drop reserved for the $PUSH holders** (which was the native token of Push Protocol).\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  <b>Migration details for existing $PUSH token holders</b>\n\n  </summary>\n\n  **For existing $PUSH token holders**, the Push Chain tokenomics proposal allocates 15% of the total Push Chain token supply specifically for migration. The migration will occur at a ratio of **1:15**—meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you'll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.\n\n  The launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:\n\n  - Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token = 15 Push Chain tokens).\n  - Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.\n  - Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them. These rewards will be distributed to token migrators if they stake their migrated Push Chain tokens, to reward them for long-term contribution to the ecosystem.\n  - For example, if you have 100 Push Protocol $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 750 Push Chain tokens when you migrate and 750 Push Chain tokens after 3 months — for a total of 1,500 Push Chain tokens. You can choose to stake these tokens to get additional rewards from the Push Chain yield farming pool, distributed periodically.\n\n  The Push Chain token migration will be open for 12 months after launch, after which any remaining tokens will go to the community and ecosystem reserve.\n\n</details>\n<p />",

                  "what-is-push-chain": "### What is Push Chain?\n\nPush Chain is a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain built to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.\n\nBy enabling **seamless transactions from any chain** (Ethereum, Solana, EVM or non-EVM), it lets any user interact with web3 apps without juggling multiple wallets, tokens or gas mechanics.\n\nIn short, Push Chain unites L1s 🤝 L2s 🤝 L3s under one cohesive layer.\n\n---",
                  "how-does-push-chain-work": "### How does Push Chain work?\n\n![How Normal Apps Work](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/normalapps.webp)\n\n![How Universal Apps Work](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/universalapps.webp)\n\nPush Chain takes a unique approach to solving the problem of fragmentation across all chains. Instead of relying on interoperability protocols, which add complexity for both users and developers, it takes a novel approach by building a true universal blockchain that can be natively used by any user from any chain.\n\nTo achieve this, Push Chain leverages several **precompiles** which are custom modules created to:\n\n1. **Recognize** users of other chains - Universal address standard that extends the address of a user to be blockchain agnostic (based on [CAIP-10 standards](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md)).\n\n2. **Map** users to Push Chain - a Universal Executor Account (UEA) is deployed for each external-chain user. This module is used to deploy a smart account that then uses other precompiles to process the transactions.\n\n3. **Execute** universal transactions - This is done by using USV (Universal Signature Verification) and UTXV (Universal Transaction Verifier) precompiles to verify and execute signatures and transactions from other chains.\n\n4. **Abstract** away the complexities of the chain they are on - This is done by having universal gateway contracts on each chain that locks gas funds in native token of the chain (or any other compliant token) and then uses the UTXV precompiles to attribute the gas to UEA (Executor Account) and USV to execute the transaction.\n\nThis is an **extremely powerful approach** that allows users to interact with any app on Push Chain without worrying about the chain they are on or what wallet they are using as everything is abstracted away, for both the users and the developers.\n\n---",
                  "why-unique-for-users": "### Why is Push Chain unique for users?\n\nPush Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, state access across chains, programmable solvers and wallet abstraction resulting in **true full-stack interoperability**. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.\n\nPush Chain's focus is on being a **shared state chain** for universal (interoperable) applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use Push Chain as universal hub or do settlement between them.\n\nIt offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from **Any Chain.** For **Any Wallet / User.** And is suitable for **Any App.**\n\n---",
                  "core-innovations": "### What Makes Push Chain Innovative?\n\n![Push Chain Architecture](/assets/website/chain/knowledge/faq/pcoverview.webp)\n\nPush Chain is a Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 designed to eliminate fragmentation across every blockchain. Under the hood, it combines several key innovations:\n\n- **True Universal Chain**  \n  Natively supports all chains and enables users to interact with the same app. No centralized relayers, bridges, or other hacks needed.\n\n- **Universal Fee & Wallet Abstraction**  \n  Allows users to interact with the app from any chain without worrying about gas or wallet mechanics.\n\n- **Single transaction for any chain**  \n  Users only ever sign one transaction, no matter which chain they’re on.\n\n- **Universal Smart Contracts**  \n  100% EVM compatible smart contracts that can be deployed with **zero on-chain code changes**. Once deployed, they become instantly compatible with users of all chains.\n\n- **Universal EVM**  \n  Push Chain is smart enough to natively recognize users of other chains and correctly attributes and maps the transactions to them.\n\n- **Shared State and Programmable Solvers**  \n  (Roadmap) Enables smart contracts of Push Chain to read and write state to any other chain.\n\nTogether, these features let you build **universal web3 apps**. Instead of \"Uniswap on Ethereum\" or \"Uniswap on Polygon,\" a user simply becomes **user of Uniswap** — period.\n\n---",

Push Chain avoids these bottlenecks by offering instant finality and universal fee abstraction at the base layer.\n\n- **True Shared State**  \n  To read & write the state of multiple chains within smart contracts, you need direct, protocol-level access—only available at the L1 layer.\n\nIn short, only a purpose-built L1 can unify every chain under one cohesive execution and settlement layer — without extra complexity or added trust assumptions.\n\n---",

Push Chain extends that model in four key ways:\n\n1. **Universal Wallet Compatibility**  \n\t- Supports chain agnostic addresses from any chain (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos SDK, etc.)  \n\t- Signatures from any chain are verified via USV/UTXV precompiles, so users never switch wallets.\n\n2. **Universal Smart Contracts**  \n\t- EVM contracts deploy unchanged but can natively verify and execute cross-chain transactions.  \n\t- Push Chain's runtime handles signature mapping and payload parsing for every supported network.\n\n3. **On-Chain Shared State**  \n\t- Validators commit Merkle proofs of external chain state (via MPT roots) each block.  \n\t- Relayers fetch and submit leaf proofs on demand, so contracts can read any chain's data in real time.\n\n4. **Programmable Solvers**  \n\t- A solver network executes atomic cross-chain workflows (e.g., swap on Chain A, mint on Chain B) under a single transaction.  \n\t- Developers write simple solver scripts; the network handles routing and execution.\n\nTogether, these features turn Push Chain into a **shared-state L1** that enables universal apps to be native to all chains.

                  "consensus-mechanism": "### What consensus mechanism does Push Chain use?\n\nPush Chain uses **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus, built on the **CometBFT** engine, with several enhancements:\n\n- **Fast Finality**: Transactions are finalized in ~1–2 seconds, with deterministic finality (no reorgs)\n- **Energy Efficient**: PoS is environmentally sustainable compared to PoW\n- **Validator Network**: Decentralized network of validators securing the chain\n- **Slashing Protection**: Economic incentives ensure validator honesty\n\nCometBFT’s battle-tested BFT consensus is optimized here for the unique requirements of universal transaction processing and cross-chain state management.\n\n---",
                  "transaction-fees": "### How do transaction fees work on Push Chain?\n\nPush Chain revolutionizes fee payment with **Universal Fee Abstraction**:\n\n- **Pay in Any Token**: Users can pay gas in ETH, SOL, USDC, or any supported token\n- **Cross-Chain Fee Payment**: Pay fees from your origin chain without bridging\n- **Gasless Transactions**: Apps can sponsor user transactions for seamless UX\n- **Dynamic Fee Market**: Fees adjust based on network demand\n\nThis means users never need to acquire native Push Chain tokens just to interact with apps.\n\n---",
                  "true-universal-chain": "### What does True Universal Chain mean?\n\nA **true universal chain** is a blockchain that treats every other network as first class citizens—no bridges, no centralized relayers, and no compatibility hacks. It delivers:\n\n1. **Native Multichain Identity**  \n\tWallets from Ethereum, Solana, any EVM or non-EVM chains all sign, verify and execute natively on Push Chain. So users never switch accounts or are troubled by the complexities of multiple wallets.\n\n2. **Unified Settlement**  \n\tTransactions from any network finalize on Push Chain, giving everyone a single source of truth and enabling the same app to be accessible by users of all chains.\n\n3. **Single Transaction and Universal Fee Abstraction**  \n\tUsers sign just one transaction, regardless of their source chain and pay gas in any token. No more maintaining or swapping countless tokens to use an app.\n\n4. **Deploy Once, Use Everywhere**  \n\tDevelopers write and deploy smart contracts once (EVM or otherwise) with **zero** extra code — one deployment covers all chains.\n\nPush Chain is the first to bake these features directly into its consensus and runtime, truly eliminating fragmentation — no workarounds, no extra layers, just one universal chain for everyone.\n\n---",

Push Chain is different—it's the first **true** universal L1 that:\n\n- **Unifies users across chains**  \n\tEvery blockchain address is natively supported. Wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, etc are all compatible with Push Chain. Gas is paid in any token on any chain.\n\n- **Acts as a universal execution layer**  \n\tAll transactions finalize on the same chain, ensuring everyone interacts with the same app—no hacks, no workarounds.\n\n- **Correctly attributes & executes any chain's transactions**  \n\tTransactions are signed, verified, and attributed to wallets on their source chains.

                  "vs-bridges-messaging": "### How is this different from bridges or messaging layers?\n\n**Short Answer**: Push is where your app runs. Bridges/messaging just move tokens or messages between chains which complicates everything for the user and developers.\n\n- **Single home vs many clones**  \n\tWith bridges/messaging you deploy per chain and sync via messages. On Push you deploy once; everyone hits the same contract and shared state.\n\n- **No wrapped assets or mandatory bridging**  \n\tUsers stay on their home chain and pay with what they already hold; we handle routing and fee conversion under the hood.\n\n- **Unified identity & verification**  \n\tWe accept signatures from any wallet/chain and attribute them to the same user on Push — non-custodial.\n\n- **Fewer moving parts**  \n\tNo cross-chain approval dance, no gas-token hunting, no glue contracts to keep in sync.\n\n- **Use bridges when you want, not because you must**  \n\tLiquidity can still move via bridges, but interacting with your app doesn't require it.\n\n**Result**: simpler apps, one source of truth, and a UX that feels like one chain — even when users aren't.\n\n---",

Current services of Push Protocol remain a priority, ensuring they continue to improve while benefiting from the new infrastructure.\n\nToday's push notification and chat protocols will benefit significantly from being built on top of Push Chain. A dedicated section of the team will focus on maintaining and enhancing these protocols, ensuring they remain the de-facto standard in their respective domains.\n\nBy aligning with Push Chain, notifications and chat sent through the protocols will be processed as transactions on the chain. This integration not only enables these protocols to accrue value but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in their evolution, further enhancing their utility and impact within the web3 ecosystem.\n\n---",

It strengthens collaborations by enabling partners to build and scale universal applications.\n\n---",
                  "decentralization-scaling": "### How will Push Chain maintain decentralization while scaling?\n\nOur Devnet demonstrated how we'll scale using dynamic sharding and parallel execution—boosting throughput without compromising decentralization.\n\nOn testnet, we focused on full stack interop with the chain running on [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft), a battle-tested, Byzantine-fault-tolerant engine. The network achieved sub-second finality and has the ability to handle up to [20k transactions per minute](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-chain/blob/main/docs/testnet-performance.md).\n\nThis proof of concept is just the beginning. As we roll out further scaling optimizations in later phases, we're confident Push Chain can meet the demands of universal applications—securely and without centralization.\n\n---",

Anyone can run a node and participate in the network and is incentivized or penalized through PoS. To Summarize:\n\n- Validators and other actors operate independently and are incentivized through PoS.\n- Governance mechanisms ensure community involvement.\n- Every ecosystem party is included in governance to some extent.\n\nTo learn more about how to run a node, see our [Knowledge Base](/knowledge/) or check out our [Validator Node Repo](https://github.com/pushchain/push-chain-node).\n\n---",

          "question": "How is this different from bridges or messaging layers?",
          "answer": "<1><2>Short Answer</2>: Push is where your app runs. Bridges/messaging just move tokens or messages between chains which complicates everything for the user and developers.</1><1><2>Single home vs many clones.</2> With bridges/messaging you deploy per chain and sync via messages. On Push you deploy once; everyone hits the same contract and shared state.</1><1><2>No wrapped assets or mandatory bridging.</2> Users stay on their home chain and pay with what they already hold; we handle routing and fee conversion under the hood.</1><1><2>Unified identity & verification.</2> We accept signatures from any wallet/chain and attribute them to the same user on Push — non-custodial.</1><1><2>Fewer moving parts.</2> No cross-chain approval dance, no gas-token hunting, no glue contracts to keep in sync.</1><1><2>Use bridges when you want, not because you must.</2> Liquidity can still move via bridges, but interacting with your app doesn't require it.</1><1>Result: simpler apps, one source of truth, and a UX that feels like one chain — even when users aren't.</1>"
