  "reason": "The previous section subtitle was good, but I felt it was missing the ultimate benefit of the chain - reaching every user. I've added \"and reach users everywhere\" to the subtitle. I changed the cta link title to \"Start building on Push Chain today\" which is more direct, and more action-oriented. I also changed the docs link title to \"Read the Docs\" for brevity."
