## Deploying and Working with Remix

Remix is an IDE tool provided by Ethereum to enable EVM smart contract development. If you have already added [Push Chain config](/docs/chain/setup/tooling/wallet-setup 'Documentation to add Push Chain as custom network in any third party wallet') to your wallet, you can use Remix to debug or deploy your smart contracts on Push Chain Testnet or Mainnet.

<RemixIDE
  examples={{
    'Counter.sol':
      'https://github.com/push-protocol/push-chain-examples/blob/main/contracts/hello-world/src/Counter.sol',
  }}
/>

## Setting up Local Dev Environment

You can use any EVM tooling including Foundry or Hardhat to deploy your smart contracts.

:::info Recommended Practice

Work on your smart contract exactly the same way you would on Ethereum, then use Push Chain configuration to deploy your smart contracts on Push Chain.

### Foundry Config

### Hardhat Config
